![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1000x300.png?text=Fuzzy+Expert+System+&+NLP+Chatbot)

This project is a web-based expert system that leverages **fuzzy logic** for complex decision-making. It features a conversational interface powered by a **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** chatbot, built with Python and Supervised Learning, and served via a Flask API.

The core application is built with **Laravel**, which provides the user interface and the expert system logic, while consuming the Python chatbot model for intelligent, human-like interaction.

## 🚀 Core Features

* **Fuzzy Expert System:** Implements fuzzy logic rules to handle uncertainty and provide nuanced recommendations or diagnoses.
* **NLP Chatbot:** A supervised learning model trained to understand user queries and provide relevant responses.
* **Decoupled Architecture:** The user-facing expert system (Laravel) is separate from the AI model (Python/Flask), allowing for independent development and scaling.
* **API Integration:** The Laravel backend communicates with the chatbot model through a clean REST API.
* **Interactive UI:** A simple and effective chat interface for users to interact with the expert system.

## 🏛️ System Architecture

The project is divided into two main components that run independently but communicate with each other.
